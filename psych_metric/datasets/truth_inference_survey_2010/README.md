# Data Description
"Truth Inference in Crowdsourcing: Is the Problem Solved?" 2010

TODO: although this is the exact data they provided and used in the survey, most of the data is not necessarily from this survey itself, and are instead from different sources. Thus the original source still needs cited and provided. The addition of missing citations etc to this readme can be done whenever someone writes about the data section anyways because we'll need to find the original paper citations at that time.

For example, this uses the TREC dataset, and the Ipieretos datasets.

Also note, this dataset has standardized the data to have an answer.csv and truth.csv that contains the annotators'/workers' answers and the assumed ground truth. As far as I know, none of these have an actual ground truth (rather than golden labels or gold standard that are typically taken from aggregated annotators with methods that are being shown to be inferior, like majority vote).
