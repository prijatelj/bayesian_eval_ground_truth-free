"Truth Inference in Crowdsourcing: Is the Problem Solved?" Zheng et al. 2017.
Original code is available at: <https://github.com/zhydhkcws/crowd_truth_infer>

The project page is at: <https://zhydhkcws.github.io/crowd_truth_inference/index.html>

The code contained in this directory is the modifications of their provided code for their surveyed truth inference methods to fit within our evaluation framework.

The modifications include:
- Converting the code from python 2 to python 3
- Including the ability to pass either a random seed or a random state for reproducibility
- The extraction of the methods from the rest of the project code (which consisted of copying and renmaing for clarity).
