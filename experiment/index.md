Experiment Related files
==
All experiment files/scripts/helpers that are not directly related or necessary for the core project to run and operate, but rather were used in the running of the project code.
This includes items for reproducibility such as the set of random seeds used for initializing different instances of the methods and also includes scripts used for running on the specific computer cluster ([Note Dame CRC][1]).
