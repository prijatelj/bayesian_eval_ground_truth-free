# Research Repository for ND CVRL + PA Joint Metric Research

## Repository Structure

Loosely follows [Cookiecutter](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) structure

## Initializing Environment

`# TODO: move this to INSTALL.md`
1.  Add Repository to your `PYTHONPATH` with `source set_environment.sh`
2.  Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
2.  Create anaconda environment from `.yaml` file

## Communication

Slack `#metric` channel on ND CVRL Slack

## Progress Tracking

Trello

## Reports, Proposals, Ideas

Shared Google Drive Folder

## Code and Data

The preferred process is:
1. Create a new branch
2. edit that branch
3. `git pull --rebase` changes from master
4. Make a merge request
5. Discuss changes
6. Merge with master

But given the nature of the project trivial changes to the repository can be pushed to master without that process.

Data should be linked in shared google drive folders, make sure to add data folders to .gitignore before pushing.
