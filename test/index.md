# Unit Tests
All unit tests for the `psych_metric` package are contained within.
Testing requires pytest and uses current installed

## TODO
- Add test of installing the `psych_metric` package, its dependencies, etc as a virtual env.
    + use that virtual env for testing and destroy upon completion?
    + have this be optional, ie. allow testing of current installed package and current environment.
